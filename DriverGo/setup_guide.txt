Driver Hiring App - Setup Guide (Windows)
========================================

Files added:
- backend/.env.template
- admin/.env.local.template
- mobile/.env.template
- setup_env.bat (Windows batch)
- setup_env.ps1 (PowerShell script called by the batch)
- .gitignore already exists (do not commit secrets)

HOW TO RUN THE SETUP (Windows)
1. Unzip the project to a folder, e.g., C:\projects\driver_hiring_project
2. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell as your user (no admin needed).
3. Navigate to the project folder:
   cd C:\projects\driver_hiring_project\driver_hiring_project_starter
4. Run the setup script by double-clicking 'setup_env.bat' or via command line:
   setup_env.bat
   (If PowerShell execution policy blocks the script, run PowerShell as Administrator and execute:
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    Then run setup_env.bat again.)

WHAT THE SCRIPT DOES
- Prompts you for required keys (Firebase Project ID, Razorpay keys, Postgres URL, Google Maps key, etc.)
- Writes backend/.env, admin/.env.local, and mobile/.env files with your values
- DOES NOT install dependencies or run npm/flutter commands (manual step per your request)

AFTER SETUP (manual steps)
1. Backend
   cd backend
   npm install
   # If using docker-compose:
   docker-compose up --build

2. Admin
   cd admin
   npm install
   npm start

3. Mobile (Flutter)
   cd mobile
   flutter pub get
   # Ensure google-services.json (Android) or GoogleService-Info.plist (iOS) are placed correctly per Firebase setup

SECURITY NOTES
- Never commit actual .env files or serviceAccountKey.json to Git.
- Use GitHub Secrets or GCP Secret Manager for production deployments.
- Replace test Razorpay keys with live keys before going to production.

If you want, I can also create a small checklist to validate each integration after you run setup. Let me know!
